# CheckersGame

A checker game for IOs.
#
Game engine is under development.

Things I've developed so far:
1. Checkers movement (one step forward either left or right, including egde cases (positioning at the left and right sides of the board))
2. Checkers beat (forward beat diagonally for both colors, removing beated checker)
